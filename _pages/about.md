I am a Computer Science and Engineering Junior at Indian Institute of Technology, Goa. I am extremely passionate about research especially in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am always looking to be a part of impactful research groups who work on projects which aim at bringing a change in the world through the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am also diving deep into the field of Web Development as well! I love to explore new technologies and spend my time working on interesting projects not limited to the above fields. 

I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges as well by participating in coding contests on Codeforces and Atcoder. Previously, I have also contributed to several Open Source Programs like Girlscript Summer of Code, Sanscript Summer of Code, etc. I am a very hardworking and ambitious individual who believes that wherever I lack in terms of my skill, I make it up with my determination to learn. I strive for excellence in each and every task that I do while learning as much as possible. I enjoy working in teams alot and I am passionate about working and improving myself every day. I possess appreciable leadership qualities and public speaking skills. I am a huge advocate of promoting diversity in STEM related fields and I am always looking for opportunities to support them. 

Apart from pursuing my academic interests, I enjoy graphic designing and sketching in my free time. I really enjoy participating in dramas and expressing myself through drawings and paintings. I also love listening to music and reading Medium articles.
