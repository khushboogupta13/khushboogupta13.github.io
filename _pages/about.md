I am a Computer Science and Engineering Sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Goa. I am mostly interested in Competitive Programming and working in Web Development and in Research in Machine Learning, NLP and their applications. **I am actively looking for a Research Internship for the Summer of 2021. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, drop me mail/message and I'll get back to you!** I love to explore new technologies and spend my time working on interesting projects.

I am currently exploring the field of Android Development by working on a project under the Wootech Winter Mentorship Program. To further imrpove myself in the field of Web Development, I am currently learning React and Django. I have previously worked on a research project called 'How many Topics?' in the field of Topic Modeling under Girlscipt Summer of Code 2020 where we researched on finding a suitable value of the number of topics which would suit almost all datasets. I am planning to publish a blog on the same soon! 

I am a huge advocate of promoting diversity in STEM related fields and I am always looking for opportunities to support them. Apart from pursuing my academic interests, I am extremely passionate about graphic designing and artwork. I lead GrafiKo, which is the Graphic Designing club of IIT Goa. I really enjoy participating in dramas and expressing myself through drawings and paintings.
