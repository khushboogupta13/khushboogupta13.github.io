## Machine Learning Mini Projects | [Code](https://github.com/khushboogupta13/Basic-ML-Algorithms)

Implemented Several Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes algorithm, Decision Trees, etc. some of the major datasets I worked on included making a House Pricing Prediction Model and Spam Email Classifier. I also made a Face Recognition and Mood Detection model using OpenCV.

## Response Visualisation 

Building a Javascript Application using libraries like ChartJS which helps to visualise the responses collected using Google Forms.
