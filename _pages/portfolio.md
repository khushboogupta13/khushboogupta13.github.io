## Fake News Classifier | [Code](https://github.com/khushboogupta13/NEWS-CLASSIFIER-1)

An ML application made under an open source program by Lets Upgrade to help users get notified about dubious news sources using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

## How many topics? | [Code](https://github.com/khushboogupta13/How_Many_topics)

An open source project under Girlscript Summer of Code 2020 based on Topic Modeling, Classification, Natural Language Processing which aims to find a suitable value of number of topics which would suit almost all the datasets.

## BMC Complaints Management App | [Code](https://github.com/khushboogupta13/Road-App)

A MERN stack application developed under Hackoverflow Hackathon at Cepheus, 2021. The web application is aimed at improving the communication between citizens, government officials and agency members by providing suitable functionality to each one of them. 

## Machine Learning Mini Projects | [Code](https://github.com/khushboogupta13/Basic-ML-Algorithms)

Implemented Several Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes algorithm, Decision Trees, etc. some of the major datasets I worked on included making a House Pricing Prediction Model and Spam Email Classifier. I also made a Face Recognition and Mood Detection model using OpenCV.

## Response Visualisation 

Building a Javascript Application using libraries like ChartJS which helps to visualise the responses collected using Google Forms.
